# Projects-in-C-Sharp
This is a basic short project of OOP to make a Salary Slip system using C# language.
The requirements were given to me for the project as 
"A company want to calculate and show the Employees their Salary Slips. The company calculates the salaries as follows: all the employees have base salary of $1500 along with fuel allowance and medical allowance. For engineer, the fuel and medical allowances are $100 and $500 respectively. For manager, the fuel and medical allowances are $250 and $1000 respectively. For analysts, the fuel and medical allowances are $150 and $800 respectively.
Write a class SalarySlip that will ask the user for his designation and show his gross salary."
